## Hola, my name is Luis Tena.
I am a Back-End Software Developer from Venezuela. Mostly my experience comes from JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. I am closer to the terminal (DevOps tools end-user) and server code than the UI.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Python projects and waiting for Mojo to be production-ready.
I got bored with React and the whole JS framework fatigue, so I am all for HTMX + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS (and maybe Web Components)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Mojo and Pulumi / Devspace for deployments and playing with Fleet for mobile Python development.
